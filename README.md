# Space-Simulation
this is a program to simulate planets interactions

you can enter the planets data and the program will show you the expected scenario

there are a lot of features helps you save state and load it again and more to have a good experience with our program

there are a lot of ready demos may impress you !


# Main Idea
this program basically depends on:

1- ewton's law of universal gravitation

( F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2 )

G: the gravitational constant

m1, m2: the masses of these two objects

r: the distance between the centers of the masses

F: the gravitational force acting between them

we use this Formula to calculate the force berween each pair of planets

-------------------------------------------

2- Newton's Second Law of Motion

( F = m * a ) => ( a = F / m )

m: mass of the object

F : Total Force applied on it

a: the acceleration of it

We Use this Fomula to calculate the acceleration of the planets depending on the total force applied on them

# installation

first open cmd in the place you want to download the project in then write this commands :

1- git init

2- git pull https://github.com/suliman-99/Space-Simulation.git

3- pipenv install

4- pipenv shell

5- python main.py

enjoy it!
